# Data Visualization on Car Sales

## üöÄ Project Overview
This detailed data analysis project explores a comprehensive dataset from CarDekho to uncover insights into used car sales, focusing on various factors that influence vehicle pricing and popularity. Through rigorous data exploration and visualization, this project aims to provide valuable insights to both consumers and dealers in the used car market.

## üìä Data Description
The dataset includes a range of features related to car sales such as make, model, year, selling price, mileage, fuel type, and more. The data is meticulously organized into training, testing, and validation sets to ensure a thorough analytical process.

## üîç Detailed Analysis Phases

### Data Collection
- Gathered comprehensive used car data from the CarDekho website.

### Understanding the Data
- **Numerical and Categorical Analysis**: Detailed description and statistical analysis of both numerical and categorical data features.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Methods to clean and preprocess the data for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Univariate Analysis**: Deep dive into individual features to understand their distribution and impact.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Examined relationships between two variables and their correlations.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Explored complex interactions between multiple variables to detect patterns and anomalies.
- **Insights and Reports**: Generated detailed reports highlighting significant findings from the analysis.

### Data Visualization Techniques
- **Visualizations Created**:
  - **Line Charts**: To track trends over time within the dataset.
  - **Pie Charts**: For showing the proportion of categories.
  - **Stacked Bar Charts**: To compare parts of a whole across different categories.
  - **Donut Charts**: A variation of pie charts with a round cut out in the middle.
  - **Histograms**: For distribution of numerical data.
  - **Scatter Plots**: To identify correlations and trends between two variables.
  - **Bar Charts**: For comparing quantities corresponding to different groups.
  - **Heatmaps**: To visualize data matrix that indicates magnitude of a phenomenon as color.

### Interactive Features
- **Dropdown Menus**: To allow users to choose the category of data they want to view.
- **Zoom and Pan**: Enable users to focus on specific details of the visualization.
- **Hover Details**: Display additional information when the user hovers over a part of the visualization.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **Python** for programming.
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for creating static and interactive visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook** as the development environment to execute and share the analysis seamlessly.

## üìù Key Insights
The analysis provides critical insights into how various factors such as vehicle age, brand popularity, fuel type, and mileage influence the selling prices of used cars. These insights can help sellers set appropriate prices and buyers to make informed decisions.
